In this exercise, you will apply the equations for calculating heights and widths as discussed in the Box Model lesson.

The sample element you are working with is:

#div1 {
	height: 150px;
	width: 400px;
	margin: 20px;
	border: 1px solid red;
	padding: 10px;
}

For this object, calculate:

Total height: 20 (top margin) + 1 (top border) + 10 (top padding) + 150 (content height) + 10 (bottom padding) + 1 (bottom border) + 20 (bottom margin) = 212px
Total width: 20 (left margin) + 1 (left border) + 10 (left padding) + 400 (content width) + 10 (right padding) + 1 (right border) + 20 (right margin) = 462px
Browser calculated height: 1 (top border) + 10 (top padding) + 150 (content height) + 10 (bottom padding) + 1 (bottom border) = 172px
Browser calculated width: 1 (left border) + 10 (left padding) + 400 (content width) + 10 (right padding) + 1 (right border) = 422px
